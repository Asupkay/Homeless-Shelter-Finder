# Homeless Shelter Finder
This project was made as part of SSW 545 (Human Computer Interaction) at Stevens Institute of Technology. This class aims to tech us how to create applications that users enjoy using by making them as intuative as possible. This application is a mock application to help users find homeless shelters near them looking for specific talent.

This application uses React, MongoDB, and Node.js in order to create an interactive application where the volunteers are able to find relevant homeless shelters and shelter employees can create job postings.
